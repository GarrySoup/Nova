                 * Things to be fixed:
                 * - Transaction spam, the tracker sends a transaction per entity movement packet, per player. That's a lot
                 * of used bandwidth.
                 * - Distance calculation. It's not perfect at all. Use the raytrace from the client.
                 * - Split transactions. The tracker currently does not handle this, but it doesn't matter that much
                 * as the time between the relative movements and each transaction is insanely small.
